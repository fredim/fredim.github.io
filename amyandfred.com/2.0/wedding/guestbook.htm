Bruce (the shark) - San Jose - Thursday, February 24, 2005 at 17:23:09 (PST)<hr>

<b>Awww...look at my little brother all grown up and mature-like. The story behind those little kid photos is adorable -- Fred was sent to school with his own little suit and tie, as any precious, cherished, only Korean son should, and he took them off for the pictures! My mom was so annoyed that she actually wrote the details on the back of his school photos. She also noted that Fred couldn't stop smiling at the tender age of 5, 6, etc.

Well, as we all know, Fred has never been able to stop smiling, and he certainly has many smiles in store with his bride-to-be. I'm so very excited for both of you as you start your married life together.</b><br>

Thanks for including Christina, Annalise and I in 'Family and Friends.' I honestly had goosebumps (the last time I experienced this was during Annalise's birth) as I was reading both of your stories and the proposal description.

You guys did a wonderful job putting this gem of a website together.
