            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Every 
              month my best friends Jenny and Junko and I meet for dinner. We 
              take turns choosing a place and give each other scores for the food, 
              ambiance, service and creativity of the restaurant we picked. At 
              the end of the year, the person with the lowest score has to take 
              the other two out for dessert and a movie. This game we play is 
              fun and we constantly try to outdo the other. So when it was Junko's 
              turn, it didn't occur to me that her restaurant selection way out 
              in Half Moon Bay wasn't anything more than a desperate move for 
              the currently losing player to gain some much needed brownie points. 
              The moment we arrived, Jenny pulled out her camera and began snapping 
              pictures of the scene, of me, and of Junko. But if you know Jenny, 
              you know she can be an odd cat at times. Besides, as a twist to 
              our normal restaurant game, we decided that we each had to make 
              a page for a scrapbook that would detail the events of each dinner. 
              I figured she was getting photos for the book. So again, it didn't 
              occur to me that anything was different about this dinner. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
              restauarnt we arrived at was the Moss Beach Distillery. We were 
              seated by the panoramic window overlooking the rocky cliff and ocean. 
              I headed 
              towards a seat facing more of the parking lot than the ocean, but 
              as I pulled out my chair Junko stopped me and asked if I'd like 
              to take a better seat to face the ocean. I was already starting 
              to sit down so I thanked her for the offer and took the seat I had 
              already claimed. What nice friends I have, I thought.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It 
              was a quiet night being a Wednesday, so there were only a handful 
              of other patrons. We began looking over the menu and gabbing about 
              normal stuff. But between chats, Junko would frantically play with 
              her cell phone, ranting about how awful her phone was. She must 
              have played with that phone a dozen times, trying to fix something 
              it seemed. For me, it was getting really irritating and between 
              bites I finally told Junko to leave her damn phone alone. After 
              all, we are civilized people and can have a nice dinner without 
              phone calls from boyfriends. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Dinner 
              finished and we began looking over the dessert menu. Then from the 
              corner of my eye, the waitress who had been oddly eying me for the 
              latter part of the night joined a group of other waiters and waitresses 
              as they paraded down the restaurant. I thought, how fun, it's someone's 
              birthday! But who? There were only three other groups here and everyone 
              else seemed to be just as puzzled about the little fiasco. Then 
              I squinted my eyes to get a better look at the tray the leading 
              waitress was holding. It had a little cake, but no candle. Odd, 
              I thought. Where's the birthday candle? Then in the crowd of waiters 
              and waitresses, I swear I see Fred. Not only was it Fred, but it 
              was Fred dressed in his suit. What!? Is that him? What is he doing 
              here? This is MY girls night out. Is it an emergency? Why is he 
              wearing his suit? (<i>All these thoughts happening of course in 
              only seconds</i>.) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Then 
              it hits me. What is that sitting next to the cake on the tray? A 
              red box? A <i>tiny</i> red box? And like that...I suddenly realize 
              as I put together all the moments of the night: The odd restaurant 
              location, the crazy photos, the seating arrangement (<i>they wanted 
              me to face the ocean so I wouldn't see Fred's car pull into the 
              lot</i>), the frantic phone messaging (<i>to warn Fred</i>), the 
              odd waitress, the cake with no candle, Fred, Fred dressed up, and 
              finally the little red box.. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">And 
              so it happened that night with my two best friends by my side, my 
              knight in shining armour got down on his knees ....</font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">After 
              talking about it a little before, I spent a couple of months ring 
              shopping. Not like I could tell what the difference was. And after 
              having some input from Amy about what she liked, and disliked, I 
              ordered the ring in April of 2004. </font> </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Then, 
              I waited.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Given, 
              that the estimate provided by the jeweller was in the 4-6 week range, 
              the ring certainly was not late by any means. But the waiting just 
              dragged on. There were times, during April and in early May, that 
              I thought, &quot;How convenient it would be if the ring would be 
              finished by this date, so I can propose.&quot; But no. It took almost 
              the full 6 weeks.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
              fact, it was in the 5th week (still no ring), that this plan was 
              hatched. The girls have a monthly dinner where they take turns picking 
              a place. Since it wasn't Amy's turn, I could pick the place and 
              arrange with her friends to meet them after dinner. So I started 
              calling around, looking for a romantic setting to propose. And I 
              called the jeweller, who was optimistic that the ring would com 
              in on schedule.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
              fact, the ring was scheduled to come in the Friday before. But more 
              on that later.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Amy 
              and I both love the coastline, and I thought the most romantic place 
              would be near Half Moon Bay, at sunset. The restaurant rated most 
              romantic down that stretch was in a small cozy building overlooking 
              Moss Beach on a bluff, the Moss Beach Distillery. (They even have 
              a ghost!) Dinner was scheduled with Jenny and Junko to start at 
              7 so that I could propose around 7:30, around sunset.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I also 
              arranged a room at a bed and breakfast in Half Moon Bay, so we could 
              wander leisurely the next day. Oh, and many thanks to Amy's boss, 
              who I cold-called at work to get her the day off! In fact, I later 
              heard that when I called, he was in a meeting with her.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Back 
              to the waiting! It turns out the ring was not ready on the Friday 
              before. Or the Saturday. The jeweller's weekend being Sunday-Monday, 
              I was quite glad to hear his voice on Saturday, saying that the 
              ring was there! But, alas, he wanted to clean and polish, so I scheduled 
              the pickup on Tuesday. Come Tuesday, as anxious as I was, everything 
              went fairly smoothly. Particularly handing over the second largest 
              check I'd ever written (the first was the downpayment for our<br>
              condo).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Finally, 
              the day had come. After work, Jenny and Junko met us over at our 
              place, ready to pick Amy up. On time even! (Good job, Junko!) As 
              they drove off at 6pm, I scrambled. Given an hour, I showered, dressed, 
              packed (for both me and Amy). Crap! It's already 6:30. And then 
              off to the car, drove up and checked in to the B&amp;B. Time check,7. 
              Deep breaths. Don't want to be too early.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Previously, 
              I'd arranged to text-message Junko, so I could let her know I was 
              ready. As I drove up to the secluded beach town location, I noticed 
              a slight flaw in my plan. No signal. So I drove slowly by the restaurant 
              noting the windows, and parked.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">One 
              eking signal bar, so I paged Junko, and waited about 5 minutes. 
              I got ansy. It was already 7:30. I called the restaurant. After 
              explaining to the hostess my intentions, she described the layout 
              of the restaurant and how the girls were sitting in a table next 
              to the entryway. So I couldn't go in that way. She told me to come 
              around the side of the restaurant, through the kitchen.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Well, 
              the girls took their sweet time. Probably wondering why I hadn't 
              called, and wondering if they had to stall any longer. Their waitress 
              came out to chat with me, and I ordered dessert for the girls, while 
              I hung out with the chefs. I was so nervous, they offered me a drink.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">And 
              then, it was time for dessert. Taking a big gulp, I got in line 
              behind the waitress as we made our way over to the table. Things 
              get blurry from here. I remember seeing Amy with a big smile, and 
              getting on my knee to propose. And she didn't say anything, but 
              she kissed me. The people there cheered for us, so nice of them.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It 
              all started with Fred IMing us and telling us that he had Amy's 
              ring and was asking for suggestions as to where he should propose. 
              Being the social couple they are, they were booked every single 
              weekend the month of June. At first Fred wanted to fly to Florida 
              and meet up with Amy, who was there for a bachelorette party. Of 
              course that idea was quickly &quot;x'd&quot; out when we calculated 
              the prices and realized Amy would be upset if Fred spent so much 
              money. So Fred asked if he could propose to Amy at our next monthly 
              dinner. Each month the three of us would meet up for dinner and 
              take turns picking out a different ethnic restaurant. We then would 
              grade the restaurant on several criteria and at the end of the year 
              the loser pays for dessert and a movie. Since Junko had not chosen 
              a restaurant, we decided to go with Fred's plan. Fred wanted to 
              pick some place romantic but not too obvious and decided on Moss 
              Beach Distillery. So that Wednesday, we picked Amy up and told her 
              we were heading off to Half Moon Bay for dinner. Amy was clueless 
              since she knew Junko was hurting for points HAHAHAH. Driving up 
              to the restaurant Amy was commenting on how far it was and how windy 
              the road was. &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; &quot;I'm hungry!&quot;<br>
              I think we remember Amy commenting on deducting points for the extra 
              long<br>
              distance.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">When 
              we finally reached the restaurant we tried to get Amy to sit on 
              the side that didn't quite face the parking lot just incase she 
              saw Fred pull up. Luckily, the whole time she was clueless and commenting 
              on how nice the restaurant was. The plan was for Fred to send a 
              text message to us when he arrived but both our phones had really 
              poor reception. During dinner we kept checking our phones to see 
              if either of us had gotten a message from Fred saying he had arrived, 
              which got Amy slightly irritated. (She doesn't like boyfriends calling 
              and disturbing our dinner HAHAHA) Since dinner went by so fast, 
              we decided to order dessert to stall. Then all of a sudden the lights 
              dimmed and the waitress brought out a dessert with Fred behind her 
              looking sharp in his suit. We were both trying to take good pictures 
              but we were too busy crying and giggling at the same time. </font></p>

              things settled, Fred joined us to eat our dessert and Oh &#133; 
              he paid for our dinner (Amy, he's a keeper!!!) <br>
              The rest of the night we pretty much spent admiring them and of 
              course&#133;the <br>
              beautiful ring. We said our farewells at the parking lot as they 
              left for their romantic evening alone. </font></p>
