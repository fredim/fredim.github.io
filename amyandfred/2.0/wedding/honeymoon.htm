                <p>We started our honeymoon on a four-day Windjammer cruise from 
                  Miami to the island of Nassau in the Bahamas. We sailed on the 
                  S.V. Legacy, a four-masted sail boat (imagine a pirate ship). 
                  This four-masted Barquentine, formerly the France II, was built 
                  in 1959 by Forges et al Meditterranee of Le Havre, France and 
                  served as a meteorological research vessel for the French Government. 
                  Acquired by Windjammer in 1989, she was renovated with custom 
                  interiors, spacious accommodations and state-of-the-art navigational 
                  systems. </p>
                <p>We usually sailed at night and then anchored in the early afternoon. 
                  We would pile into little boats that would then take us to deserted 
                  islands. The first island we went to had sting rays! You had 
                  to be careful stepping into the water. The sting rays were 
                  so friendly and are used to humans so they would swim right 
                  up to you and let you touch them. Their underbellies are so 
                  soft.</p>
                <p>When we docked at Nassau, that offically ended our cruise and 
                  began our island adventure. We stayed at the Sandals resort, 
                  an all-inclusive exclusive resort specifically for honeymooners 
                  and other couples (no kids). The food was decent but can't say 
                  it was excellent. They have a few &quot;five star&quot; restaurants, 
                  but we weren't really sure where they got their stars from. 
                  But since the food was free, we gorged ourselves which is always 
                  fun. Sandals has a small island which they boat people to. The 
                  island has a restaurant on it called Goombay Cafe. That was probably 
                  one of the tastier nights but there were sooo many bugs. They 
                  were so small you coudn't see them, but you could definitely 
                  feel them make a meal out of your skin. Fred got chewed up quite 
                  a bit on his arm, but we were luckily warned before going so 
                  we both had long pants on, even though it was soooo hot and 
                  humid. On the last night we decided to leave the resort in search 
                  for a great restaurant. We found ourselves, with two other couples, 
                  at the Poop Deck. It was really good, but then again...lobster 
                  is always good!</p>
                <p>Though there were quite a few activities we could have partook 
                  in, we chose the lazy route and spent most of the five days 
                  lounging in the pool next to the bar. We did, however, leave 
                  the comfort of the pool to do an underwater sub adventure and 
                  to sail on a mini sailboat.</p>
                <p><b>The Sub Adventure</b></p>
                <p>This was a first for us. We've snorkeled before, but this was 
                  truly a different adventure. The best way to explain it was 
                  we were on underwater scooters. We each got our own &quot;scooter&quot; 
                  which had your basic go/stop function. Our heads were in a glass 
                  bubble that was filled with oxygen, but the rest of our body 
                  was directly touching the water. The subs didn't move too fast, 
                  a precaution we presumed to prevent any accidents. The top of 
                  our bubble helmets were connected to a buey that kept us from 
                  toppling to the side (and thus filling our bubble helmet with 
                  water). It was really interesting and there were tons of fish. 
                  When we were finished with the subs, we were given 30 more minutes 
                  to snorkel. Fred and I purchased fish food and were able to 
                  take some pretty good underwater shots where we were surrounded 
                  by hundreds of hungry fishies.</p>
                <p>It was difficult to come home after the honeymoon and we were 
                  immediately thinking about what our next vacation would be. 
                  Doing absolutely nothing was wonderful and perfect for a honeymoon, 
                  but now we're looking for more adventures for our next trip!</p>
