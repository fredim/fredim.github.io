                <p><b><a name="amy"></a>Amy's Version of the Proposal</b> 
                <p>Every month my best friends Jenny and Junko and I meet for 
                  dinner. We take turns choosing a place and give each other scores 
                  for the food, ambiance, service and creativity of the restaurant 
                  we picked. At the end of the year, the person with the lowest 
                  score has to take the other two out for dessert and a movie. 
                  This game we play is fun and we constantly try to outdo the 
                  other. So when it was Junko's turn, it didn't occur to me that 
                  her restaurant selection way out in Half Moon Bay wasn't anything 
                  more than a desperate move for the currently losing player to 
                  gain some much needed brownie points. The moment we arrived, 
                  Jenny pulled out her camera and began snapping pictures of the 
                  scene, of me, and of Junko. But if you know Jenny, you know 
                  she can be an odd cat at times. Besides, as a twist to our normal 
                  restaurant game, we decided that we each had to make a page 
                  for a scrapbook that would detail the events of each dinner. 
                  I figured she was getting photos for the book. So again, it 
                  didn't occur to me that anything was different about this dinner. 
                <p>The restauarnt we arrived at was the Moss Beach Distillery. 
                  We were seated by the panoramic window overlooking the rocky 
                  cliff and ocean. I headed towards a seat facing more of the 
                  parking lot than the ocean, but as I pulled out my chair Junko 
                  stopped me and asked if I'd like to take a better seat to face 
                  the ocean. I was already starting to sit down so I thanked her 
                  for the offer and took the seat I had already claimed. What 
                  nice friends I have, I thought.</p>
                <p>It was a quiet night being a Wednesday, so there were only 
                  a handful of other patrons. We began looking over the menu and 
                  gabbing about normal stuff. But between chats, Junko would frantically 
                  play with her cell phone, ranting about how awful her phone 
                  was. She must have played with that phone a dozen times, trying 
                  to fix something it seemed. For me, it was getting really irritating 
                  and between bites I finally told Junko to leave her damn phone 
                  alone. After all, we are civilized people and can have a nice 
                  dinner without phone calls from boyfriends. </p>
                <p>Dinner finished and we began looking over the dessert menu. 
                  Then from the corner of my eye, the waitress who had been oddly 
                  eying me for the latter part of the night joined a group of 
                  other waiters and waitresses as they paraded down the restaurant. 
                  I thought, how fun, it's someone's birthday! But who? There 
                  were only three other groups here and everyone else seemed to 
                  be just as puzzled about the little fiasco. Then I squinted 
                  my eyes to get a better look at the tray the leading waitress 
                  was holding. It had a little cake, but no candle. Odd, I thought. 
                  Where's the birthday candle? Then in the crowd of waiters and 
                  waitresses, I swear I see Fred. Not only was it Fred, but it 
                  was Fred dressed in his suit. What!? Is that him? What is he 
                  doing here? This is MY girls night out. Is it an emergency? 
                  Why is he wearing his suit? (All these thoughts happening of 
                  course in only seconds.) </p>
                <p>Then it hits me. What is that sitting next to the cake on the 
                  tray? A red box? A tiny red box? And like that...I suddenly 
                  realize as I put together all the moments of the night: The 
                  odd restaurant location, the crazy photos, the seating arrangement 
                  (they wanted me to face the ocean so I wouldn't see Fred's car 
                  pull into the lot), the frantic phone messaging (to warn Fred), 
                  the odd waitress, the cake with no candle, Fred, Fred dressed 
                  up, and finally the little red box.. </p>
                <p>And so it happened that night with my two best friends by my 
                  side, my knight in shining armour got down on his knees ....</p>

                <p>After talking about it a little before, I spent a couple of 
                  months ring shopping. Not like I could tell what the difference 
                  was. And after having some input from Amy about what she liked, 
                  and disliked, I ordered the ring in April of 2004. </p>
                <p>Then, I waited.</p>
                <p>Given, that the estimate provided by the jeweller was in the 
                  4-6 week range, the ring certainly was not late by any means. 
                  But the waiting just dragged on. There were times, during April 
                  and in early May, that I thought, &quot;How convenient it would 
                  be if the ring would be finished by this date, so I can propose.&quot; 
                  But no. It took almost the full 6 weeks.</p>
                <p>In fact, it was in the 5th week (still no ring), that this 
                  plan was hatched. The girls have a monthly dinner where they 
                  take turns picking a place. Since it wasn't Amy's turn, I could 
                  pick the place and arrange with her friends to meet them after 
                  dinner. So I started calling around, looking for a romantic 
                  setting to propose. And I called the jeweller, who was optimistic 
                  that the ring would com in on schedule.</p>
                <p>In fact, the ring was scheduled to come in the Friday before. 
                  But more on that later.</p>
                <p>Amy and I both love the coastline, and I thought the most romantic 
                  place would be near Half Moon Bay, at sunset. The restaurant 
                  rated most romantic down that stretch was in a small cozy building 
                  overlooking Moss Beach on a bluff, the Moss Beach Distillery. 
                  (They even have a ghost!) Dinner was scheduled with Jenny and 
                  Junko to start at 7 so that I could propose around 7:30, around 
                  sunset.</p>
                <p>I also arranged a room at a bed and breakfast in Half Moon 
                  Bay, so we could wander leisurely the next day. Oh, and many 
                  thanks to Amy's boss, who I cold-called at work to get her the 
                  day off! In fact, I later heard that when I called, he was in 
                  a meeting with her.</p>
                <p>Back to the waiting! It turns out the ring was not ready on 
                  the Friday before. Or the Saturday. The jeweller's weekend being 
                  Sunday-Monday, I was quite glad to hear his voice on Saturday, 
                  saying that the ring was there! But, alas, he wanted to clean 
                  and polish, so I scheduled the pickup on Tuesday. Come Tuesday, 
                  as anxious as I was, everything went fairly smoothly. Particularly 
                  handing over the second largest check I'd ever written (the 
                  first was the downpayment for our<br>
                  condo).</p>
                <p>Finally, the day had come. After work, Jenny and Junko met 
                  us over at our place, ready to pick Amy up. On time even! (Good 
                  job, Junko!) As they drove off at 6pm, I scrambled. Given an 
                  hour, I showered, dressed, packed (for both me and Amy). Crap! 
                  It's already 6:30. And then off to the car, drove up and checked 
                  in to the B&amp;B. Time check,7. Deep breaths. Don't want to 
                  be too early.</p>
                <p>Previously, I'd arranged to text-message Junko, so I could 
                  let her know I was ready. As I drove up to the secluded beach 
                  town location, I noticed a slight flaw in my plan. No signal. 
                  So I drove slowly by the restaurant noting the windows, and 
                  parked.</p>
                <p>One eking signal bar, so I paged Junko, and waited about 5 
                  minutes. I got ansy. It was already 7:30. I called the restaurant. 
                  After explaining to the hostess my intentions, she described 
                  the layout of the restaurant and how the girls were sitting 
                  in a table next to the entryway. So I couldn't go in that way. 
                  She told me to come around the side of the restaurant, through 
                  the kitchen.</p>
                <p>Well, the girls took their sweet time. Probably wondering why 
                  I hadn't called, and wondering if they had to stall any longer. 
                  Their waitress came out to chat with me, and I ordered dessert 
                  for the girls, while I hung out with the chefs. I was so nervous, 
                  they offered me a drink.</p>
                <p>And then, it was time for dessert. Taking a big gulp, I got 
                  in line behind the waitress as we made our way over to the table. 
                  Things get blurry from here. I remember seeing Amy with a big 
                  smile, and getting on my knee to propose. And she didn't say 
                  anything, but she kissed me. The people there cheered for us, 
                  so nice of them.</p>

                <p><b><a name="they"></a>Jenny &amp; Junko's Version of the Proposal</b></p>
                <p>It all started with Fred IMing us and telling us that he had 
                  Amy's ring and was asking for suggestions as to where he should 
                  propose. Being the social couple they are, they were booked 
                  every single weekend the month of June. At first Fred wanted 
                  to fly to Florida and meet up with Amy, who was there for a 
                  bachelorette party. Of course that idea was quickly &quot;x'd&quot; 
                  out when we calculated the prices and realized Amy would be 
                  upset if Fred spent so much money. So Fred asked if he could 
                  propose to Amy at our next monthly dinner. Each month the three 
                  of us would meet up for dinner and take turns picking out a 
                  different ethnic restaurant. We then would grade the restaurant 
                  on several criteria and at the end of the year the loser pays 
                  for dessert and a movie. Since Junko had not chosen a restaurant, 
                  we decided to go with Fred's plan. Fred wanted to pick some 
                  place romantic but not too obvious and decided on Moss Beach 
                  Distillery. So that Wednesday, we picked Amy up and told her 
                  we were heading off to Half Moon Bay for dinner. Amy was clueless 
                  since she knew Junko was hurting for points HAHAHAH. Driving 
                  up to the restaurant Amy was commenting on how far it was and 
                  how windy the road was. &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; &quot;I'm 
                  hungry!&quot;<br>
                  I think we remember Amy commenting on deducting points for the 
                  extra long<br>
                  distance. </p>
                <p>When we finally reached the restaurant we tried to get Amy 
                  to sit on the side that didn't quite face the parking lot just 
                  incase she saw Fred pull up. Luckily, the whole time she was 
                  clueless and commenting on how nice the restaurant was. The 
                  plan was for Fred to send a text message to us when he arrived 
                  but both our phones had really poor reception. During dinner 
                  we kept checking our phones to see if either of us had gotten 
                  a message from Fred saying he had arrived, which got Amy slightly 
                  irritated. (She doesn't like boyfriends calling and disturbing 
                  our dinner HAHAHA) Since dinner went by so fast, we decided 
                  to order dessert to stall. Then all of a sudden the lights dimmed 
                  and the waitress brought out a dessert with Fred behind her 
                  looking sharp in his suit. We were both trying to take good 
                  pictures but we were too busy crying and giggling at the same 
                  time. </p>
                <p>As things settled, Fred joined us to eat our dessert and Oh 
                  &#133; he paid for our dinner (Amy, he's a keeper!!!) <br>
                  The rest of the night we pretty much spent admiring them and 
                  of course&#133;the <br>
                  beautiful ring. We said our farewells at the parking lot as 
                  they left for their romantic evening alone. </p>
                <p>Congrats to our best friend and her husband to be!! Love you 
                  guys!</p>
