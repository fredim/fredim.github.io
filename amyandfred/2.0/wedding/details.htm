                <p>Not many people do save the date cards anymore, but we had 
                  an idea and thought it was really cute and decided to run with 
                  it. We found photos of each of us when we were little, turning 
                  them to black and white to keep the design clean and simple. 
                  Then we merged and printed the images to a card, and wrapped 
                  a vellum slip printed with the date and location of our wedding, 
                  and tied a green bow around it.</p>

                <p>Invites were hand made from scratch using green hard stock 
                  as the back paper, cut and folded into a pointed petal-shape 
                  design. Wedding details were printed against cream paper and 
                  pasted on top of a matching green decorative paper, topped with 
                  a small jewel at the top center. Additional information sheets 
                  and RSVP postcards were cut into sizes that when put together, 
                  cascaded down, revealing the title of each sheet. These sheets 
                  were then tied together with a green bow, placed in the middle 
                  of the invite with a square vellum piece above it. The petals 
                  of the invite were folded closed and sealed with a pretty cream 
                  ribbon. (Thanks Junko for your help!)</p>

                  details of our invitations to our programs and table settings 
                  - using the same green decorative paper, ribbons, and jewels.

                  They originally were chosen purely for their beauty, but it 
                  ended up being a very very hot day with no cloud in sight. As 
                  it worked out, these parasols actually became very useful as 
                  everyone sought shelter from the hot sun.</p>

                <p>The actual reception took place inside the Hill House, a long, 
                  wood-floored open room with a full length of windows that opened 
                  up to an amazing view of both the vinyard and the Bay Area below. 
                  Because the location was so beautiful and colorful on its own, 
                  we chose simple table decorations with peridot table cloth, 
                  cream napkins, chocolate name seating tags covered with matching 
                  green paper, and a beautiful orchid in a bamboo basket as the 
                  centerpiece.</p>

                <p>Bouquets (and boutteniers) were handmade by Amy and her bridesmaids. 
                  The bride's bouquet was full of large cream roses, green orchids, 
                  freesia, verburnum and bear grass. Bridesmaids bouquets were 
                  comprised of large cream roses, jumbo white carnations, 
                  freesia and bear grass. It took lots of hard work and a coordinated 
                  effort to get these done the night before the wedding, but we 
                  did it. Thanks ladies for a job well done!</p>

                  We decided that if there were ever to be doves released at a 
                  wedding, we were at the right location. The winery perched atop 
                  the Santa Cruz mountains made for the perfect setting. High 
                  in the mountains with a wide open view, and surrounded purely 
                  by nature's beauty...the dove release was actually quite spectacular. 
                  (We hope they made it home as there was a mischievious hawk 
                  flying overhead!)</p>

                  to use them for our wedding. Trying to stay in line with the 
                  simplicity of our wedding, we chose pure cream colored frosting 
                  piped with a delicate design that matched our green decorative 
                  paper. Thanks to Christina and Claudia who helped decorate it
